<br>
AI learns to play Flappy Bird Game, I have coded the game in python using the pygame library and the source file is named Flappy_Bird.py <br>
and have used NEAT for training different generations of birds to play the game.<br>
Necessary Data for NEAT algorithm can be found in Config.txt, and have called neat algorithm mainly in run function in the file Flappy_Bird.py.
